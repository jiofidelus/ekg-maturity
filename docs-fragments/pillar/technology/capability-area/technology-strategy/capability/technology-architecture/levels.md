# Levels


## Levl 1: Enterprise Knowledge Graph initialization
The following scenario can be considered during the lighthouse project:
- A simple monolitic application made up of a file containing the knowledge graph in RDF, JSON, OWL or any format and the CRUD operation on this knowledge graph. The main goal here is to learn and master the technologies and the challenges behind.
- A simple monolitic application with a Web interface and a KG in a file. The CRUD operation for adding new knowledge in the graph is implemented. The users use Web interface to experience these operations on the graph.
- A simple monolitic application using any graph database for knowledge storage. In this case, the developers knows the challenges to implemented enterprise knowledge graph and they are preparing to move to the level 2. The end users requirements are described using for instance Unified Modeling Language (UML), implemented and tested. 

At the end of the first level, we consider that the developers master the technologies to use to implement the system based on the KG. These are:
- The graph database: we consider that during the Graph initialization, the users have defined how to store the knowledge
- We consider that the developers have also defined how to access to the knowledge stored in the graph database
The development can thus move to the next step which is extensible platform.

## Level 2: Extensible platform
The extensible platform consists of developing the platform using the KG. Thus, all the users 



## Level 3: Enterprise ready
This may consists of the deployment of the monolitic and make it accessible to the community. Thus, it can be used and feedback used for its improvement.

## Level 4: Strategic Assets
The feedback of the first users allowed us to have an improved version of the application that can be valuable. On the other hand, the limits perceived from the level 3 is used to improve the application.

## Level 5: Operational ecosystem
The application is used, the use cases identify, the development approach is review (for instance, the DevOps approach can be considered) and the architecture is also review. For instance, some modules of the application can be most demanded compared to others and need to be scale up. More services can be identified and need to be developed using different programming languages.
