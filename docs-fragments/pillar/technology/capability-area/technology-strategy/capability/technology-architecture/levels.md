# Levels


## Levl 1: Enterprise Knowledge Graph initialization
the lighthouse project may consists of a monolitic application. 



## Level 2: Extensible platform
This may consists of the local testing of the monolitic, so to validate the different use cases.


## Level 3: Enterprise ready
This may consists of the deployment of the monolitic and make it accessible to the community. Thus, it can be used and feedback used for its improvement.

## Level 4: Strategic Assets
The feedback of the first users allowed us to have an improved version of the application that can be valuable. On the other hand, the limits perceived from the level 3 is used to improve the application.

## Level 5: Operational ecosystem
The application is used, the use cases identify, the development approach is review (for instance, the DevOps approach can be considered) and the architecture is also review. For instance, some modules of the application can be most demanded compared to others and need to be scale up. More services can be identified and need to be developed using different programming languages.
